Prologue - Morgan
	Guard 1: Cold night.
	Guard 2: Yeah.
	Guard 1: You know what would pass the time?
	Guard 2: Besides doing our job without distractions?
	Guard 1: For God's sake, lighten up. We're sharing this assignment for the rest of winter.
	Guard 1: Are you going to stand in silence the entire time? 
	Guard 2: Fine. What do you want me to say?
	Guard 1: You could start by telling me about yourself.
	Guard 2: I am Kynro, a legionnaire of the Empire. 
	Guard 2: End of trivia.
	Guard 1: What about your Aptitude?
	Guard 2: I beg your pardon?
	Guard 1: You know, the ability were you born with! For instance, I can see very well in the dark,
	Guard 1: my wife can heal bruises, and my son-
	Guard 2: I know what an Aptitude is, but you should only care about one:
	Guard 2: The ability to conjure fire.
	/The background of the dialogue changes to an image of a necklace, with a glowing red pendant.
	Guard 2: Our task is to protect the Mad Queen Morkana's invocation relic from any who would wish to revive her.
	Guard 1: Yeah, yeah. You've said it a dozen times.
	Guard 1: But there's only one person in the world who COULD revive her:
	Guard 1: someone who inherited her Aptitude for fire.
	Guard 1: And there's no way of knowing if such a person has even been born!

	/Player is given control of Morgan, who, upon approaching a locked side door, burns it down using her Aptitude.
	/Once inside, she touches the pendant. 
	/Cut to front of the building catching fire, and the guards rushing in.
	Guard 1: Stop right there!
	Guard 2: Put the necklace back where you found it, or we'll do it ourselves after we take it off your corpse!
	/Morgan (now the reborn Morkana) turns to face the guards
	/She looks different, a bit crazier, and is now wearing the necklace and sporting a sinister expression
	/She immolates the two guards. Fade out.
